        <h2>Importing fonts</h2>
        <p>It used to be a pain in the arse but now we use @fontface and specify a url to the font file the browser can download then use .selector {font-family: 'name-of-font'} to use it on certain elements.</p>

            Another option is to use an online font service such as google fonts or adobe typekit. These are a breeze to use as they host, serve and optiise the font for you(me). For the purpose of learning this tutorial I'll use Rubik from Google fonts.</p>
        <h2>Font sizing</h2>
        CSS has 15 different units for font sizing.
They can be grouped in 2 categoiries:
<ol>
    <li>
        Absolute such as px
    </li>
    <li>
        Relative such as em
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Relative sizes take their cue from the parent element. So if a paragraph is set to 2em and its parent element, let's say a div, is set to 16px, that 1em in the paragraph translates to 32px.
</p>    
<h3>Typescale</h3>
<p>Generally you'll want a range of sizes to use in your project.</p>

<p>Cue, the typescale. It's a way to establish a range of harmonious font sizes that work well with each other. "More often than not, youâ€™ll see hierarchies that are six level deep, which corresponds to the HTML heading elements, h1 through h6." Taimur Abdaal on https://css-tricks.com/typography-for-developers/</p>

<p>Below I've used https://type-scale.com to generate a typescale.</p>

<h4>Augumented forth - 1.414</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        5.653rem/90.44px
    </li>
    <li>
        3.998rem/63.96px
    </li>
    <li>
        2.827rem/45.23px
    </li>
    <li>
        1.999rem/31.99px
    </li>
    <li>
        1.414rem/22.62px
    </li>
    <li>
        1rem/16.00px
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Vertical spacing</h2>
<p>Usually achieved via the line-height property.</p>

<p>Is a way to control the distance between lines of text. Usually the browser defaults to 1.2, but that is too tight. For long form text something closer to 1.5 works better.</p>

<p>This combined with margins, padding etc. forms (vertical) rythm.</p>

<h2>Horizontal spacing</h2>
<p>Tracking is the space between letters of a word. It's controlled by the letter-spacing property. Ems are the preferred units of measurement.</p>

<p>Line width - best practice for long form copy is to have between 60 and 70 characters per line. Use the ch unit. It is a relative unit define by the lentgh of tha character 0 (zero).</p>

<p>"Because narrow characters like l and i are relatively frequent, setting the width of a text container to something like 50ch should result in lines that are 60-70 character long."</p>

<h2>Antialiasing</h2>
<p>Rendering gray pixels to make fonts appear smoother.</p>

    <p>-webkit-font-smoothing - supported only on webkit browser but firefox and chrome must have an equivalent.</p>
